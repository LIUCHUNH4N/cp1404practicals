# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy varied throughout the course. Initially, I often underestimated the time required to complete tasks, 
particularly for more complex ones. I tended to focus only on the coding aspect and didn't account for debugging, testing, or understanding new concepts.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the course progressed, my estimates became more accurate. I started factoring in all aspects of the task, 
including time for learning new topics, refactoring, and writing tests. 
By reflecting on previous estimates and outcomes, I was able to adjust my approach, leading to better time management.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

As the course progressed, my estimates became more accurate. I started factoring in all aspects of the task, including time for learning new topics, refactoring, and writing tests. By reflecting on previous estimates and outcomes, I was able to adjust my approach, leading to better time management.
I also realized that it's okay to adjust estimates as you gain more clarity on the task.
Estimating is not just about predicting time; it's also about understanding the task itself more deeply.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed by others taught me the value of diverse perspectives. Reviewers often pointed out potential issues or improvements that I hadn't considered. 
It reinforced the idea that code quality improves when multiple people contribute to reviewing it. I also learned to be more open to constructive criticism.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

...

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  

For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

https://github.com/jennihxxn/cp1404practicals/pull/3#pullrequestreview-2203399942

### Explanation

In this review, I provided constructive feedback on improving code readability by suggesting clearer variable names. 
I also highlighted the importance of handling exceptions in the code, which would make the application more robust and user-friendly.

### Good Code Review 2

https://github.com/SaiOhmSaiePaine/cp1404practicals/pull/2#event-13498194496

### Explanation

For this review, I focused on the logic flow and suggested a more efficient algorithm to reduce the overall complexity of the code. 
I also pointed out the need for better documentation and comments to enhance code maintainability, which is crucial when working in collaborative environments.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

There is nothing I want to change.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently applied the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and made sure my code was modular and well-structured.
