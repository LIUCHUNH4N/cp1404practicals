# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

40%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I will watch lecture videos in the school study room on Thursday and Friday afternoons.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Application of loop statements and functions.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop focusing only on syntax and start understanding the algorithms better.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I didnâ€™t break down complex problems into smaller, more solvable parts before I started writing code. I should have first planned my approach to solving each problem before writing any code.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am good at debugging and troubleshooting my code to find and fix errors quickly. I will continue to use my debugging skills to improve my code quality.
